            <b>Tutankhamun</b>,<sup>[a]</sup> commonly referred to as <b>King Tut</b>, was an <a href="">ancient
                Egyptian pharaoh</a> who was the last of his royal family to rule during the end of the <a href="">18th
                Dynasty</a> (ruled c. 1332 – 1323 BC in the <a href="">conventional chronology</a>) during the <a
                href="">New Kingdom</a> of <a href="">Egyptian history</a>. His father is believed to be the pharaoh <a
                href="">Akhenaten</a>, identified as the mummy found in the tomb <a href="">KV55</a>. His mother is his
            father's sister, identified through DNA testing as an unknown mummy referred to as "<a href="">The Younger
                Lady</a>" who was found in <a href="">KV35</a>.<sup>[9]</sup>
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Tutankhamun took the throne at eight or nine years of age under the unprecedented viziership of his eventual
            successor, <a href="">Ay</a>, to whom he may have been related. He married his half sister <a
                href="">Ankhesenamun</a>. During their marriage they lost <a href="">two daughters</a>, one at 5–6
            months of pregnancy and the other shortly after birth at full-term.<sup>[10]</sup> His names—Tutankhaten and
            Tutankhamun—are thought to mean "Living image of Aten" and "Living image of Amun", with <a href="">Aten</a>
            replaced by <a href="">Amun</a> after Akhenaten's death. A small number of Egyptologists, including
            Battiscombe Gunn, believe the translation may be incorrect and closer to "The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing" or,
            as Professor Gerhard Fecht believes, reads as "One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten".
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Tutankhamun restored the <a href="">Ancient Egyptian religion</a> after its dissolution by his father,
            enriched and endowed the priestly orders of two important cults and began restoring old monuments damaged
            during the previous <a href="">Amarna period</a>. He moved his father's remains to the <a href="">Valley of
                the Kings</a> as well as relocating the capital from <a href="">Akhetaten</a> back to <a
                href="">Thebes</a>. Tutankhamun was physically disabled with a deformity of his left foot along with
            bone necrosis that required the use of a cane, several of which were found in his tomb. He had other health
            issues including <a href="">scoliosis</a> and had contracted several strains of <a href="">malaria</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            The 1922 discovery by <a href="">Howard Carter</a> of Tutankhamun's <a href="">nearly intact tomb</a>, in
            excavations funded by <a href="">Lord Carnarvon</a>,<sup>[11]</sup> received worldwide press coverage. With
            over 5,000 artifacts, it sparked a renewed public interest in <a href="">ancient Egypt</a>, for which <a
                href="">Tutankhamun's mask</a>, now in the <a href="">Egyptian Museum</a>, remains a popular symbol. The
            deaths of a few involved in the discovery of <a href="">Tutankhamun's mummy</a> have been popularly
            attributed to the <a href="">curse of the pharaohs</a>. He has, since the discovery of his intact tomb, been
            referred to colloquially as <b>"King Tut"</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Some of his treasure has traveled worldwide with unprecedented response. The <a href="">Egyptian Supreme
                Council of Antiquities</a> allowed tours beginning in 1962 with the exhibit at the <a href="">Louvre</a>
            in Paris, followed by the <a href="">Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art</a> in Tokyo, Japan. The exhibits drew in
            millions of visitors. The 1972–1979 exhibit was shown in United States, Soviet Union, Japan, France, Canada,
            and West Germany. There were no international exhibitions again until 2005–2011. This exhibit featured
            Tutankhamun's predecessors from the 18th Dynasty, including <a href="">Hatshepsut</a> and Akhenaten, but did
            not include the golden death mask. The treasures 2019–2022 tour began in Los Angeles and will end in 2022 at
            the new <a href="">Grand Egyptian Museum</a> in Cairo, which, for the first time, will be displaying the
            full Tutankhamun collection, gathered from all of Egypt's museums and storerooms.

            Tutankhamun, whose original name was Tutankhaten or Tutankhuaten, was born during the reign of <a
                href="">Akhenaten</a>, during the late <a href="">Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt</a>.<sup>[12]</sup>
            Akhenaten's reign was characterized by a dramatic shift in <a href="">ancient Egyptian religion</a>, known
            as <a href="">Atenism</a>, and the relocation of the capital to the site of <a href="">Amarna</a>, which
            gave its name to the modern term for this era, the <a href="">Amarna Period</a>.<sup>[13]</sup> Toward the
            end of the Amarna Period, two other pharaohs appear in the record who were apparently Akhenaten's
            co-regents: <a href="">Neferneferuaten</a>, a female ruler who may have been Akhenaten's wife <a
                href="">Nefertiti</a> or his daughter <a href="">Meritaten</a>; and <a href="">Smenkhkare</a>, whom some
            Egyptologists believe was the same person as Neferneferuaten but most regard as a distinct
            figure.<sup>[14]</sup> It is uncertain whether Smenkhkare's reign outlasted Akhenaten's, whereas
            Neferneferuaten is now thought to have become co-regent shortly before Akhenaten's death and to have reigned
            for some time after it.<sup>[15]</sup>
        </p>
        <p class="family_text">
            An inscription from <a href="">Hermopolis</a> refers to "Tutankhuaten" as a "king's son", and he is
            generally thought to have been the son of Akhenaten,<sup>[16]</sup> although some suggest instead that
            Smenkhkare was his father.<sup>[17]</sup> Inscriptions from Tutankhamun's reign treat him as a son of
            Akhenaten's father, <a href="">Amenhotep III</a>, but that is only possible if Akhenaten's 17-year reign
            included a long co-regency with his father,<sup>[18]</sup> a possibility that many Egyptologists once
            supported but is now being abandoned.<sup>[19]</sup>
        </p>
        <p class="family_text">
            While some suggestions have been made that Tutankhamun's mother was <a href="">Meketaten</a>, the second
            daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, based on a relief from the <a href="">Royal Tomb at
                Amarna</a>,<sup>[b]</sup> this possibility has been deemed unlikely given that she was about 10 years
            old at the time of her death.<sup>[21]</sup> Another interpretation of the relief names Nefertiti as his
            mother.<sup>[c][23]</sup> Meritaten has also been put forward as his mother based on a re-examination of a
            box lid and coronation tunic found in his tomb.<sup>[24]</sup> Tutankhamun was <a href="">wet nursed</a> by
            a woman named Maia, known from her tomb at Saqqara.<sup>[25][26]</sup>

        <p class="family_text">
            In 2008, genetic analysis was carried out on the mummified remains of Tutankhamun and others thought or
            known to be New Kingdom royalty by a team from <a href="">University of Cairo</a>. The results indicated
            that his father was the mummy from tomb <a href="">KV55</a>a, identified as Akhenaten, and that his mother
            was the mummy from tomb <a href="">KV35</a>, known as the "<a href="">Younger Lady</a>", who was found to be
            a full sister of her husband.<sup>[27]</sup> This means that the KV35 Younger Lady cannot be identified as
            Nefertiti as she was not known to be a sister of Akhenaten.<sup>[28]</sup> The team reported it was over
            99.99 percent certain that <a href="">Amenhotep III</a> was the father of the individual in KV55, who was in
            turn the father of Tutankhamun.<sup>[29]</sup> The validity and reliability of the genetic data from
            mummified remains has been questioned due to possible degradation due to decay.<sup>[30]</sup> Researchers
            such as <a href="">Marc Gabolde</a> and <a href="">Aidan Dodson</a> claim that Nefertiti was indeed
            Tutankhamun's mother. In this interpretation of the DNA results, the genetic closeness is not due to a
            brother-sister pairing but the result of three generations of <a href="">first-cousin marriage</a>, making
            Nefertiti a first cousin of Akhenaten.<sup>[31]</sup>
        </p>
        <p class="family_text">
            When Tutankhaten became king, he married Ankhesenpaaten, one of Akhenaten's daughters, who later changed her
            name to <a href="">Ankhesenamun</a>.<sup>[32]</sup> They had <a href="">two daughters</a>, neither of whom
            survived infancy.<sup>[27]</sup> While only an incomplete genetic profile was obtained from the two
            mummified foetuses, it was enough to confirm that Tutankhamun was their father.<sup>[27]</sup> Likewise,
            only partial data for the two female mummies from <a href="">KV21</a> has been obtained so far. KV21A has
            been suggested as the mother of the foetuses but the data is not statistically significant enough to allow
            her to be securely identified as Ankhesenamun.<sup>[27]</sup> <a href="">Computed tomography</a> studies
            published in 2011 revealed that one daughter was born prematurely at 5–6 months of pregnancy and the other
            at full-term, 9 months.<sup>[10]</sup> Tutankhamun's death marked the end of the royal line of the 18th
            Dynasty.<sup>[33]</sup>
